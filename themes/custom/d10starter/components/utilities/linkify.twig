{#
  The accompanying `linkify.ts` script (`linkify.js` on the CMS side) gives
  this component the "pointer" cursor on hover and adds a click-handler that
  navigates to the url specified in `data-linkify-url`.

  Good for when you already have a dedicated link but another nearby element
  (an image, typically) is supposed to be a link, too. (Having "redundant" links
  isn't good for accessibility, so in this case it's actually better to have
  the supplementary link be a "fake" link.)

  Use with `embed` and `block` like this:

  {% embed '@components/utilities/linkify.twig' with {
    url: [[some url]],
    extraClasses: 'inline-block w-40'
  } %}
    {% block component %}
      <!-- markup for component goes here -->
    {% endblock %}
  {% endembed %}

  (extraClasses is optional, url is required)

  For an example, see `teaser/stacked.twig`.
#}

{# tw #} {% set interactiveClasses = 'cursor-pointer' %}

<div
  data-linkify-url="{{ url }}"
  class="{{ extraClasses|default('') }}"
  {# These classes will be added to this `div` via JS, and so won't be active for non-JS users #}
  data-interactive-classes="{{ interactiveClasses }} {{ extraInteractiveClasses|default('') }}"
>
  {% block component %}{{ component }}{% endblock %}
</div>
